# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

# Overview
The Iris Flower Classification project aims to classify iris flowers into different species based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the species of iris flowers from the well-known Iris dataset.

# Features
1. Classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica.
2. Use various machine learning algorithms for classification, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
3. Evaluate and compare the performance of different models.
4. Visualize classification results and model performance.

# Installation
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.x,Pip (Python package manager)
2. Required libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
   
# Usage
To classify iris flowers, follow these steps:
1. Load the Iris dataset:
The dataset is included in the data directory or can be loaded from a URL.
2. Run the classification script:
python classify_iris.py

# Configuration
config.json: Configuration file for model parameters and file paths.

# Evaluation
To evaluate model performance, use the provided evaluation script:

python evaluate_model.py --input results.csv --groundtruth groundtruth.csv
